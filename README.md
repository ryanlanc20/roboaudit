# Roboaudit - An API for managing your LLM usage audits
Roboaudit allows you to store audit logs for prompt-response pairs, allowing you to preserve chat history and your response evaluations.
Whether you're tracking your prompt engineering improvements over time as an individual, or evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different AI chatbots
to enable better organisational decision making, Roboaudit has you covered! The great thing about Roboaudit is that it's just an API, and it has no authentication. This means that
you can integrate it into your existing systems, developing a UI view in your existing codebase, and utilizing your existing auth system. Your users will not need to keep track
of multiple credentials, and they will always be presented with a familiar user interface!
